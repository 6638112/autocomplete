This page needs to cover:

- Plugins are a way of encapsulating sources, including the data and display. They can also trigger particular actions on an interaction.
- For example, the insights plugin sends click and conversion events.
- We provide some out-of-the-box plugins, but you can also build your own.

  - Code snippet
- We also have created a couple out-of-the box plugins:
  - Our **recent-searches plug-in** stores recently made searches in local storage so that you can incorporate an individualâ€™s recent searches into an autocomplete.
    - Code snippet + live example
  - Our **query-suggestions plug-in** is made to work with an Algolia Query Suggestions index.
    - Code snippet + live example

We'll also need to document the Plugin API.
